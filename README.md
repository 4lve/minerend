# Minerend


This is a renderer for Minecraft builds. Only supported input format at the moment is the JSON format from Building Gadgets 2.
All block data is loaded from jar files directly in the browser.

## Usage

```bash
bun install
bun run dev
```

## TODO

- [ ] Add support for more block model configurations (e.g. some mods use subfolder for their textures)
- [ ] Make it less laggy when rendering large builds
